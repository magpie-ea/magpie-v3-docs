# magpie-docs

Full documentation of _magpie.

The documentation is meant to be built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

To deploy the latest changes:

1. install mkdocs with `pip install mkdocs`,
2. optionally, also install `pip install pymdown-extensions` and use `mkdocs serve` for local inspection; and
3. run `mkdocs gh-deploy`, which will build the latest version of the documents, and publish the site with Github Pages.
